=============

Epidemics of rubella in Japan used to occur every five years e.g., 1982, 1987-1988, and 1992-1993; however, since the rubella vaccine was included in the routine immunization of children in April 1995, no nationwide epidemics have occurred. In 2004 Japan experienced small regional outbreaks. In 2011 the number of rubella cases was on the rise again after 7 years of silence. In 2011 Japan experienced 378 cases of rubella and the number increased to 2,392 cases the following year. In the first 14 weeks of 2013 the number of cases has exceeded the total number in 2012 at 3,480 cases.  Considering the possibility that some patients failed to consult doctors or to be properly diagnosed, the reported number can be a low estimate.

Large cities reported more cases and the weekly report in 2013 indicated spread of rubella from the Metropolitan areas to its surrounding prefectures. The prefecture with the largest number of cases is Tokyo with 1,182 cases in the first 13 weeks of 2013 (http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/images/idsc/disease/rubella/2013pdf/rube13-13.pdf). 

As for age distribution in 2013, most frequent were those in 30’s (33%) followed by those in 20’s (28%), 40’s (21%), ?50 years (8.0%), 15-19 years (5.5%) and <15 years (4.8%).  Thus, adults occupied about 90% of the patients.  Among males, the most frequent were those in 20-40’s, while among females the most frequent were those in 20’s (Fig. 3).  

In 2012,  among 168 strains of the virus genotyped, 132 belonged to genotype 2B (92.9%) and 35 belong to the genotype 1E (6.4%). 
In 2013, among 229 strains genotyped, 212 cases belonged to the genotype 2B (92.6%) and 15 belonged to the genotype 1E (6.6%).
